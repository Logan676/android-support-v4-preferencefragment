android-support-v4-preferencefragment
=====================================
	
Unofficial PreferenceFragment compatibility layer for Android 1.6 and up. Includes resources so add this as a library project to your project.
	
This solution is better than all other solutions. Add this project as a library project to your workspace. You can keep everything including your fragment transaction as it is and when importing the `PreferenceFragment` do it like the following.	

`import android.support.v4.preference.PreferenceFragment;`

instead of

`import android.preference.PreferenceFragment;`

You should add android-support-v4-preferencefragment as library according to http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/projects/projects-eclipse.html#ReferencingLibraryProject
	
Or download [the jar](https://dev.seafile.com/seahub/f/45df6a79b3/), and add it to the libs folder under your project (if your IDE is eclipse).
